num_data_sets: 80 # number of data sets to include. randi data has 110 so this leaves 30 for cross validation
num_train_steps: 200 # number of steps of EM
dynamics_lags: 1 # allows the dynamical system to fit weights for multiple time steps in the past. Note that this increases memory and time required by a factor of at least lags^2
dynamics_input_lags: 45 # number of time points in the past that inputs can affect the latents
emissions_input_lags: 1 # same but for emissions (not used in the paper)
ridge_lambda: Null # allows for L2 regularization of the dynamics matrix (not used in the paper)
neuron_freq: 0.1 # removes neurons that are measured less than this fraction of the data set

fit_type: em
verbose: True
use_memmap: False # allows storing of the matricies on scratch space. Significantly reduces memory usage and increases time to run
